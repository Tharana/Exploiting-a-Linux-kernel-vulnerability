# Exploiting-a-Linux-kernel-vulnerability
#ITT19159140
Local Root vulnerability- CVE-2019-13272 / Security Bypass Vulnerability â€“ CVE-2019-14287

Absolutely, I always choose Linux vulnerability, but then I had to choose different vulnerability else because I didn't know two people could do the same thing And then Having learned of this, I chose a different vulnerability, But because I had already solved that. This will include the report I did before and the new one I did later I've decided to include it separately Because I can't throw it away. Please  request that you check  both vulnerability report and come up with an idea
